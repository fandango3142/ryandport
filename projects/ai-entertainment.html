      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        At Xfinite, we pioneered AI‑generated alternative endings for films,
        opening new possibilities for storytelling and monetisation. By using
        generative models, we created multiple narrative paths that users could
        experience in the theatre or on OTT platforms.
      </p>
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        I defined the product strategy for generative AI in entertainment and
        worked closely with creative teams to integrate AI outputs seamlessly
        into the filmmaking process. I also led the negotiation with content
        partners and steered the launch of the first theatrical release with an
        AI‑generated ending.
      </p>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        The first AI‑enabled release generated significant buzz and served as
        proof of concept for further productions. By demonstrating the
        potential of AI‑driven content, we unlocked new revenue streams and
        inspired similar initiatives across the industry.
