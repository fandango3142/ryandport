      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The collections engine aggregates product catalogs into flexible,
        rule‑driven groups that can be surfaced across channels. By defining
        criteria such as replenishment frequency, cross‑sell affinity and
        trending attributes, marketers can assemble collections that adapt to
        user context and inventory.
      </p>
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        I formulated the concept, created user flows, and partnered with
        designers and engineers to craft a self‑serve UI for building
        collections. My work included prioritizing use cases, modelling
        relationship logic and ensuring the system could scale across millions
        of items.
      </p>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        Collections have become foundational to personalization strategies,
        powering replenishment, cross‑sell and merchandising campaigns. Clients
        report higher click‑through rates on recommendation widgets and
        streamlined operations for managing large catalogs.
