      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Vibe‑coding is my approach to quickly turning ideas into tangible
        prototypes. Instead of relying solely on wireframes, I write working
        front‑end code — often in React or vanilla HTML/CSS — to convey the
        intended experience. This allows stakeholders to interact with a
        concept early and provide more meaningful feedback.
      </p>
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever I need to de‑risk a design or alignment on a complex
        interaction, I jump into code. For example, while exploring the hybrid
        builder, I built multiple prototypes to test different workflows and
        UI paradigms. These prototypes were used in user studies and helped
        decide the final direction.
      </p>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        By leveraging vibe‑coding, my teams accelerate decision making and
        reduce miscommunication. Prototypes have led to cleaner designs,
        smoother development handoffs and better stakeholder buy‑in.
