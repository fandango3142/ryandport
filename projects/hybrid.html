      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The hybrid builder combines visual blocks with a code editor to give
        users the best of both worlds: intuitive drag‑and‑drop for structure
        and inline scripting for advanced logic. This approach dramatically
        speeds up solution creation while maintaining flexibility.
      </p>
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        I oversaw the product vision and execution for the hybrid builder.
        Through A/B tests and user research, we discovered that a combined
        visual/code experience reduced build time significantly versus
        typing‑only workflows. I collaborated with designers on the new UI
        language and guided engineers on modular architecture and component
        reuse.
      </p>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        Users reported significantly faster solution delivery and fewer
        mistakes. The modernised visual hierarchy also improved onboarding
        and adoption rates while refreshing the look and feel of the platform.
